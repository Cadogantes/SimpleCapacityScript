1) Install Programmable Block on your ship
2) Change the "cockpitName" and "cockpitScreen" variables in the config section of the script, a bit below
3) Copy the whole script after changes (if you didn't get the script in game)
4) While on the ship - go to Control Panel, select Programmable Block, click "Edit" button, paste the script there, click "OK", click "Run"
